# Pressco
This is a chatbot that allows customers to make print requests to specific printing presses near them. 

# Why this project:
Ever been to a printing press to have something printed only to be delayed by the long line, 
mulfunctioning devices, or the fact that someone happened to infect the devices with a virus that just wont go away?
Well, this project aims to solve that. Know exactly which printing presses are near and around you, 
what serves they offer, and get them to print your documents and deliver them to whatever location you want.
All within the comfort of your home.
